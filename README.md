# Digit Recognizer - MNIST

This repository focuses on digit recognition using two different approaches:

1. **Deep Learning with Keras:** Achieves an accuracy of approximately 99%.
2. **Machine Learning with scikit-learn:** Achieves an accuracy of about 95%.

The dataset used for this project is the [Digit Recognizer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) from Kaggle.
